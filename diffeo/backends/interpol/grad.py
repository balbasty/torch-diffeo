    """Compute spatial gradients of image according to a (voxel) displacement field.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : (B, *shape_in, C) tensor
        Input image.
        If input dtype is integer, assumes labels: each unique labels
        gets warped using linear interpolation, and the label map gets
        reconstructed by argmax.
    flow : ([B], *shape_out, D) tensor
        Displacement field, in voxels.
        Note that the order of the last dimension is inverse of what's
        usually expected in torch's grid_sample.
    bound : {'dft', 'dct[1|2|3|4]', 'dft[1|2|3|4]'}, default='dct2'
        Boundary conditions. PyTorch does not really support them,
        so "reflection" (which is equivalent to "dct2") is always used.
    has_identity : bool, default=False
        - If False, `flow` is contains relative displacement.
        - If True, `flow` contains absolute coordinates.

    Returns
    -------
    grad : (B, *shape_out, C, D) tensor
        Sampled gradients
